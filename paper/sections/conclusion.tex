\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \gpu{}, a GPU-accelerated admixture estimation tool that
achieves one to two orders of magnitude speedup over existing CPU-based
methods while preserving the exact binomial likelihood model and matching or
exceeding their solution quality.
Three complementary algorithmic innovations—FISTA-style Nesterov momentum,
stochastic mini-batch EM, and streaming randomised SVD initialisation—together
explain why \gpu{} outperforms CPU competitors in both speed and accuracy,
not hardware advantage alone.
By making multi-seed, multi-$K$ ancestry inference practical within minutes
rather than days, \gpu{} and its integrated CLUMPAK-lite post-processor
lower the computational barrier to rigorous admixture analysis at the scale
of modern biobank datasets.
