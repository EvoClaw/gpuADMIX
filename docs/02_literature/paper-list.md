CORE PAPERS (by access level)

1. Alexander et al. 2009 - ADMIXTURE - Genome Research
   Access: abstract_only
   Block relax EM + quasi-Newton; gold standard accuracy; CPU only

2. Chiu et al. 2022 - SCOPE - AJHG
   Access: FULL TEXT
   Randomized LSE + ALS + Mailman; up to 1800x faster; less accurate

3. Meisner et al. 2024 - fastmixture - PeerComm Journal
   Access: FULL TEXT v1+v2
   Mini-batch EM + QN + SVD init; 30x faster; same accuracy; CPU ONLY

4. Mantes et al. 2023 - Neural ADMIXTURE - Nature Comp Sci
   Access: full abstract + methods
   GPU autoencoder; fast; POOR ACCURACY on complex admixture

5. Gopalan et al. 2016 - TeraSTRUCTURE - Nature Genetics
   Access: abstract
   Stochastic VI; tera-scale; slower than SCOPE

6. Raj et al. 2014 - fastSTRUCTURE - Genetics
   Access: abstract
   Variational Bayes; faster than STRUCTURE; less accurate than ADMIXTURE

7. Frichot et al. 2014 - sNMF - Genetics

   NMF; 10-30x faster; available in R/LEA

8. Ko et al. 2023 - OpenADMIXTURE - AJHG
   Access: abstract
   Julia; AIM selection; GPU possible

9. Chu et al. 2024 - HaploADMIXTURE - preprint
   Access: abstract
   Uses SNP pairs; better on admixed pops

    Access: abstract
    Original EM for admixture

11. Pritchard et al. 2000 - STRUCTURE - Genetics
    Access: abstract
    Original Bayesian MCMC model
